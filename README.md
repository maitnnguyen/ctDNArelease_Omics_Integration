# Genomics and Trascriptomics Insights of ctDNA Release Mechanisms in Ovarian Cancer 

## Back ground:
- High grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is usually diagnosed at late stages but from our data, we observed that there is considerable proportion of HGSC patients showed very low ctDNA fraction. Thus, we integrated genomics and transcriptomics information from tissue biopsies to understand biological features behind ctDNA level phenotypes.
